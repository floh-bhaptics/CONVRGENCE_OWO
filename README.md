OWO mod for CONVRGENCE. If you have questions or issues, ping me in the OWO Discord.

2. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/floh-bhaptics/CONVRGENCE_OWO//releases/latest/download/CONVRGENCE_OWO.zip) of the mod and unzip the contents into the root directory of your game (one DLL goes in UserLibs, one DLL and the OWO sensations go in Mods).
